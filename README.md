# **Customer Churn Prediction**

# Problem Statement

Customer churn is one of any industryâ€™s top concerns. We know from previous studiesthat the cost of gaining a new client is considerably higher than the cost of keeping anexisting one. The percentage of consumers who quit subscribing to a service or the percen-tage of employees who leave a position is referred to churn or churn rate.Churn has affected industries such as banking, insurance, internet streaming and telecom-munications to just name a few. Although there are many reasons for customer churn, someof the major reasons are service dissatisfaction, costly subscription, and better alternatives.Hence in this project, we simulate such a churn case where we work on post-paid customerdata with a contract.The data includes information on client usage patterns, contract de-tails, and payment information. Customers who cancelled their service are also identified inthe data and based on this past data, we need to build a model which can predict whethera customer will cancel their service in the future or not.

# Our Purpose 

Build a model that will help the telecom identify the potential customers who have ahigher probability of churn the connection.
